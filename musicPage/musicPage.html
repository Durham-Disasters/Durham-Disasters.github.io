    <hr>

    <p>
      Improvements in technology have had profound effects on the music industry and has changed the way that many compose
      and create songs. While the likes of Queen operated on multiple tapes that were overdubbed and multitracked on top
      of one another, modern composers are able to use technology to easily record and edit tracks with little to no loss
      in sound quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the rise of MIDI - Musical Instrument Digital Interface - has led to new genres of music being created,
      focussing on the unique sounds that can be created with computers in comparison to traditional isntruments. The rise
      of EDM and "club" songs is testament to this, employing various synthesisers of various wave forms along with a myriad
      of effects to create interesting sounds.

      The far reaching effects of computer science on the musical world are truly limitless. For example, Jazz Pianist Mark Polishook
      even began his own project entitled "Robots-in-Residence", in which a dialogue between a robot and a human would be recorded
      and used to create a mumsical piece based upon the "rhythm" and "melody" of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another example would be a way in which computer science can help enable people to experience music in a way that they would
      otherwise be unable to.

    <h2 class="title">Computing used to help restore eardrums - PhonoGraft</h2>
    <p>
      Eardrum perforations can be caused from a variety of ear-related trauma, chronic infections or blast injuries and can
      cause serious complications for those that have them including earaches, sudden itching and even sudden hearing loss.
      While in most cases these can heal over time by themselves, there are some situations in which the hole might be too
      big and surgey would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, the surgey linked to fixing these issues is temperamental, with revision surgies being necessary due
      to surgical failures associated with the high precision of the task. However, the PhonoGraft hopes to change that.
    </p>
    <p>
      While normally, an invasive procedure would involve making an incision behind the ear, the PhonoGraft functions as a
      3D printed mold that can be installed through the ear canal using a "noninvasive endoscopic procedure". At this point
      the device functions as the native eardrum while also initiating the regeneration of native eardrum tissue - leading
      to long-term recovery for the patient
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of this revolutionary creation, the team behind the PhonoGraft are currently waiting to receive FDA
      clearance for the use of this technology in real patients.
    </p>

    <p>
      These examples demonstrate the way in which computer science has impacted and continues to revolutionise the audial
      field.
