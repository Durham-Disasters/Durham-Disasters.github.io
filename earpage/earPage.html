    <h1>Computing used to help restore eardrums</h1>
    <p>
      Eardrum perforations can be caused from a variety of ear-related trauma, chronic infections or blast injuries and can
      cause serious complications for those that have them including earaches, sudden itching and even sudden hearing loss.
      While in most cases these can heal over time by themselves, there are some situations in which the hole might be too
      big and surgey would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, the surgey linked to fixing these issues is temperamental, with revision surgies being necessary due
      to surgical failures associated with the high precision of the task. However, the PhonoGraft hopes to change that.
