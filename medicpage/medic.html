    <p>Medicine is becoming more and more a data-driven field. With biology being so complex
        a science, where the reactions of our underlying biologies are almost impossibly difficult
        to predict sometimes, it can be much easier to find patterns through the data via techniques
        such as deep-learning and neural networks.
    </p>

    <p>Some recent and relevant applications of this can be seen in the fight against Covid-19:</p>

    <p>Asymptomatic people who have COVID-19 can still spread the virus to vulnerable people,
        even if they may not know it. This has been contributing to a lot of the COVID-19 cases we see today.
    </p>

    <p>However, esearchers at MIT have found that asymptomatic people may not be so unaffected. They
        have found that, through analysis of normal and asymptomatic forced coughs, asymptomatic people
        have ever so slightly different cough sounds signatures, indecipherable to the human ear, but decipherable
        to artifical intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>The researchers conducted many forced cough recordings with volunteers, many submitted through
        the internet. With tens of thousands of recordings collected, they then trained a deep learning 
        model on these datapoints.
    </p>

    <p>On feeding the model many unseen recordings of coughs, the model accurately predicted with a 
        98.5 percent accuracy the people who had/had not had COVID-19. Developers are currently working
        on implementing the model into a user-friendly app, where it will surely save the lives of
        tens of thousands.
    </p>

    <p>Artficial Intelligence has been used for plenty of other medical applications such as:
    
    <ul>
        <li>Detecting cancer in the early stages</li>
        <li>Accurate limb reconstruction via prosthetic limbs</li>
        <li>Risk analysis of arterial clots in cardiac patients</li>
    </ul>
