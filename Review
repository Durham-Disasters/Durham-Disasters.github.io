<h1>Interest of content</h1>
<p>Sound</p>
<p>Good Variety</p>
<p>Loved the Andrei Meme/p>
<p>meme page gets a Very Good</p>





<h1>Consistency and quality of visual presentation</h1>
<p>weak</p>
<p>only nav bar on 2 of the pages, and they are different styles on both pages<p>
<p>Meme page is completely different desgin to the other pages<p>
<p>Meme page has nice layout but pictures in caroselle are squashed weirdly<p>
<p>On the education page, the highlighted blue text doesn't contrast well<p>
<p>doesn't seem like many bootstrap elements were used which means a very simple design<p>
<p>Pictures not formatted nicely into the page<p>




<h1>Quality of written presentation</h1>
<p>sound</p>
<p>Avoid using chonky paragraphs</p>
<p>Maybe write a little more</p>
<p>Not copied and pasted, very original</p>

<h1>Validity of HTML</h1>
<p>Sound</p>
<h1>Evidence of collaboration including</h1>
<p>invalid html</p>
<p>You may be using an invalid version of html</p>
<p>Navbar for the meme page has two links which aren't actually links</p>
<p>You've linked bootstrap but you haven't used bootstrap apart from the meme page</p>
<p>You've added author sections which is good</p>
<p>Git logs show that the commits are rather last minute</p>
